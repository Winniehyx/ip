# User Guide
This is Duke's user guide. It is a basic scheduling app that is easy to use.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. From www.github.com/winniehyx/ip/releases, download the latest duke.jar .

2. For Windows, open the jar file to start the app. The GUI for Duke would appear. For Mac, type `java -jar duke.jar` into the terminal to run the file.

## List of Features 
These are the following features of Duke:
### Add tasks
Add task into the tasklist.
### Delete tasks
Deletes the task from the tasklist.
### List tasks
List all the task in the tasklist.
### Mark task as done
Marks the task as done.
### Tag tasks
Tag the task added.
### Find tag/task
Display the list of task that has the tag/task in the tasklist.

## Categories of tasks
There are 3 categories of tasks:
1) Todo represented by
   [T][ ] find book
2) Deadline
   [D][ ] return book (by: 10/02/2021 1003)
3) Event
   [E][ ] project meeting (at: 10/02/2021 2000)

## Notes about commands
When there are extra parameters behind the function 'list' , the program is smart enough to know that the user wants the 'list' function so no error would be thrown and the tasklist would be displayed.

The date format should be written in the format "d/M/yyyy HHmm", else an error would be thrown.

Tag should be the last argument.
   
# Saving of commands
Commands would be saved into a file once the 'bye' command is typed into the app. Data will be saved in the directory where you saved the jar file, under /data/duke.txt . A new file would be formed if there are no existing file. If there exists an existing file, the file would be used.
